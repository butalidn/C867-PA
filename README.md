# **Scripting and Programming Applications Project**

This project was done in C++. It takes a string stream and parses the information. A student object is created for each set of data to fill a roster array. Add and remove functions were created to modify the roster. A function was created to validate a student's email. The program prints out a series of specfic tasks that were requested by the project requirements.
